# Vulnerable Kext
    A WIP "Vulnerable by Design" kext for iOS/macOS to play/learn with iOS kernel exploitation

# Usage:

Running the following command causes checkra1n to listen for attached iOS devices in DFU mode and boot pongoOS:
~~~
/Applications/checkra1n.app/Contents/MacOS/checkra1n -c -p
~~~

Run `run.sh` to build kext_loader, pongo_module, and the vulnerable kext and to start kext_loader
kext_loader waits for a device that's booted pongo shell!

~~~
./run.sh
~~~
